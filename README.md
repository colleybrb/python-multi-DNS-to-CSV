# python-multi-DNS-to-CSV
This code is a simple dns lookup for a sheet of ip's.

### What it does
* Loads "arp_lookup.csv"
* Conducst a host name lookup on each "IP."
* Prints the host names
* Sends output to excel "output.xlsx"


### Notes
* This is something I used to start programming with .
* I hope the example is a catalyst for other network guys getting into python
* I have not updated since 2018ish.
* Good adhoc function if you need to do alot of mass DNS lookups. Just wrap in lookup(df) and return data where you need it.
